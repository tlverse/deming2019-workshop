Note: `travis-ci` currently deploys the developmental version of this workshop
handbook into the `gh-pages` branch of this repository, which is hosted by
GitHub Pages at https://tlverse.org/deming2019-workshop.

The workshop materials are automatically built and deployed using
[Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which supports using R
and RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific snapshot on
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility). An
RStudio session, pre-loaded with all the materials, is available via
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tlverse/deming2019-workshop/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Welcome to the GitHub repository accompanying the half-day tutorial and 2-day 
short course on Targeted Learning with the `tlverse` software ecosystem, given 
at the Deming Conference on Applied Statistics, December 4-6, 2019. Much of the 
materials here are based on an early draft of the (eventually forthcoming) book 
**The Hitchhiker's Guide to the `tlverse`, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner's
Handbook**, by Mark van der Laan, Alan Hubbard, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana
Malenica, and Rachael Phillips. For a work-in-progress draft of the unabridged 
book, please see https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook or the associated GitHub 
repository: https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook.
