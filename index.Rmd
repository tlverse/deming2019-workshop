This is an open source and fully-reproducible electronic vignette for the 
[`tlverse` software](https://github.com/tlverse) workshops incorporated in the 
half-day tutorial (4 December 2019) and 2-day short course (5-6 December 2019) 
on applying the targeted learning methodology in practice given at the Deming
Conference on Applied Statistics. [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the `tlverse`, or 
a Targeted Learning Practitioner's 
Handbook*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/) is an in-draft book covering 
the same topics in greater detail and may serve as a useful accompanying 
resource to these workshop materials.

## About {-}

#### Half-Day Tutorial -- 9:00A-12:00P on 4 December 2019
#### Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) for Machine Learning: A Gentle Introduction
During this half-day tutorial, we will delve into the utility of the roadmap of 
targeted learning for translating real-world data applications to a mathematical 
and statistical formulation of the relevant research question of interest. 
Participants will perform hands-on implementation of state-of-the-art targeted 
maximum likelihood estimators using the `tlverse` software ecosystem in the `R` 
programming language. Participants will actively learn and apply the core 
principles of the Targeted Learning methodology, which (1) generalizes machine 
learning to any estimand of interest; (2) obtains an optimal estimator of the 
given estimand, grounded in theory; (3) integrates modern ensemble machine 
learning techniques; and (4) provides formal statistical inference in terms of 
confidence intervals and testing of specified null hypotheses of interest. It 
is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic 
statistical concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence 
intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical 
statistics may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the R programming 
language will be essential. 

#### 2-Day Short Course -- 8:00A-5:50P on 5 December 2019 and 8:00A-1:10P on 6 December 2019
#### Targeted Learning in Data Science: Causal Inference for Observational and Experimental Data
This 2-day short course will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field 
of targeted learning for causal inference and the corresponding `tlverse` 
software ecosystem. We will focus on targeted minimum loss-based estimators of 
causal effects, including those of static, dynamic, optimal dynamic, and 
stochastic interventions. These multiply robust, efficient plug-in estimators 
use state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning tools to flexibly adjust for 
confounding while yielding valid statistical inference. Estimators will be 
explored under various real-world scenarios: when the outcome is subject to 
missingness, when mediators are present on the causal pathway, in high 
dimensions, under two-phase sampling designs, and in right-censored survival 
settings possibly subject to competing risks. We will discuss the utility of 
this robust estimation strategy in comparison to conventional techniques, which
often rely on restrictive statistical models and may therefore lead to severely 
biased inference. In addition to discussion, this course will incorporate both
interactive activities and hands-on, guided `R` programming exercises, to allow participants the opportunity to familiarize themselves with methodology and 
tools that will translate to real-world analyses. It is highly recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical concepts such as 
confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, 
and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics may be useful but 
is not necessary. Familiarity with the `R` programming language will be 
essential.

## About the instructors and authors {-}

While this workshop is delivered by Mark van der Laan and Rachael Phillips, the 
majority of these materials are based on joint work with a team of six 
co-authors:

### Mark van der Laan {-}

Mark van der Laan, Ph.D., is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley. His research interests include statistical methods in computational
biology, survival analysis, censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum
likelihood estimation, causal inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and
multiple testing. His research group developed loss-based super learning in
semiparametric models, based on cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for
the estimation of infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density
estimation and prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on
this work, his research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation
for a target parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary
semiparametric and nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for
statistical and causal inference. Most recently, Mark's group has focused in
part on the development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for
targeted learning, the `tlverse`. For more information, see
https://vanderlaan-lab.org.

Rachael is a Ph.D.~student in biostatistics, advised by Alan Hubbard and Mark
van der Laan. She has an M.A.~in Biostatistics, B.S.~in Biology with a
Chemistry minor and a B.A.~in Mathematics with a Spanish minor. Rachael's 
research focuses on narrowing the gap between the theory for and application of 
modern statistics for real-world data science. Specifically, Rachael is 
motivated by issues arising in healthcare, and she leverages strategies rooted 
in causal inference and nonparametric estimation to build clinician-tailored, 
machine-driven solutions. Rachael is also passionate about free, 
online-mediated education and its corresponding pedagogy.

Jeremy Coyle, Ph.D., is a consulting data scientist and statistical programmer,
currently leading the software development effort that has produced the
`tlverse` ecosystem of R packages and related software tools. Jeremy earned his
Ph.D. in Biostatistics from UC Berkeley in 2016, primarily under the supervision
of Alan Hubbard.

### Alan Hubbard {-}

Alan Hubbard, Ph.D., is Professor of Biostatistics, former head of the Division
of Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, and head of data analytics core at UC
Berkeley's SuperFund research program. His current research interests include
causal inference, variable importance analysis, statistical machine learning,
estimation of and inference for data-adaptive statistical target parameters, and
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Research in his group is generally
motivated by applications to problems in computational biology, epidemiology,
and precision medicine.

Nima is a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics with a designated emphasis in
computational and genomic biology, working with Mark van der Laan and Alan
Hubbard. Nima is affiliated with UC Berkeley's Center for Computational Biology
and is a former NIH Biomedical Big Data fellow. He earned is Master's in
Biostatistics (2017) and a Bachelor's with a triple major in Molecular and Cell
Biology (Neurobiology), Psychology, and Public Health (2015) at UC Berkeley.
Nima's interests span nonparametric estimation, high-dimensional inference,
targeted learning, statistical computing, survival analysis, and computational
biology, with an emphasis on the development of robust and efficient statistical
methodologies that draw on the intersection of causal inference and statistical
machine learning. For more information, see https://nimahejazi.org.

Ivana is a Ph.D. candidate in biostatistics advised by Mark van der Laan. Ivana is
currently a fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, after serving as

interests span non/semi-parametric theory, probability theory, machine learning,
causal inference and high-dimensional statistics. Most of her current work
involves complex dependent settings (dependence through time and network) and
adaptive sequential designs.
